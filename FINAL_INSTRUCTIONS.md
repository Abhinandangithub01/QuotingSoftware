# üö® CRITICAL: Backend Server Issue

## Problem Identified

Your backend proxy server (port 3001) is returning **500 Internal Server Errors**. This is why:
- Customers length = 0
- Products length = 0  
- All API calls fail

## Root Cause

The backend server is either:
1. Not running properly
2. Can't connect to Zoho API
3. Has a configuration error

## IMMEDIATE FIX

### Step 1: Stop Everything

```bash
taskkill /F /IM node.exe
```

### Step 2: Start Backend Server FIRST

```bash
node server.js
```

**WAIT** - You should see:
```
üöÄ Zoho OAuth Proxy Server running on http://localhost:3001
üîê Using Zoho Auth URL: https://accounts.zoho.in/oauth/v2
```

If you DON'T see this, the server has an error!

### Step 3: Start Frontend

In a NEW terminal:
```bash
npm run dev
```

### Step 4: Test Backend

Open browser and go to:
```
http://localhost:3001/health
```

You should see:
```json
{"status":"ok","message":"Zoho OAuth Proxy Server Running"}
```

If you get an error, the backend is broken!

## If Backend Won't Start

Check `server.js` for syntax errors. The file should start with:

```javascript
import express from 'express'
import cors from 'cors'
import fetch from 'node-fetch'
import dotenv from 'dotenv'

dotenv.config()

const app = express()
const PORT = 3001
```

## Current Status

Based on your console logs:
- ‚úÖ Frontend is running (port 5173)
- ‚ùå Backend is failing (port 3001)
- ‚úÖ You have Zoho token (hasZohoToken: true)
- ‚ùå API calls return 500 errors

## Next Steps

1. **Close ALL terminals**
2. **Start backend FIRST**: `node server.js`
3. **Verify it's running**: Check for startup message
4. **Start frontend**: `npm run dev`
5. **Test**: Go to New Quote page
6. **Check console**: Should see successful API calls

## If Still Not Working

The backend server code might be corrupted. You need to:

1. Check `server.js` line by line
2. Look for syntax errors
3. Ensure all imports are correct
4. Verify `.env` file is loaded

## Success Criteria

When working correctly, you'll see in backend terminal:
```
üì° Proxying: GET /contacts
‚úÖ Success: GET /contacts
üì° Proxying: GET /items  
‚úÖ Success: GET /items
```

And in frontend console:
```
NewQuote: customers.length: 1
NewQuote: products.length: 1
```

**The backend server MUST be running and healthy for anything to work!**
